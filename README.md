# :baby: :robot: MACHINE LEARNING BASICS :robot: :baby:
This repository covers the basic concepts of Machine Learning. <br />
It begins with the necessary programming tools to understand the fundamental knowledge for development of ML solutions. <br />
Then, it goes into more advanced topics and problem-solving with powerful ML approaches. <br />
The information of these repository is based on some lectures and my own presonal projects: <br />

* MIT 6.034: Artificial Intelligence (Fall 2010) <br />

* Stanford CS229: Machine Learning (Autumn 2018) <br />
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMiGQp3WXShtMGgzqpfVfbU

* Udemy course: Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp <br />
https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/#instructor-1

* Lectures of "Intelligent Systems" from the EIA University.

## Dependencies :vertical_traffic_light:
The dependencies are mainly python libraries and the correct usage of them. <br />
My advice is to primary understand the "pip" package installer, before working with other dependencies.


### Software dependencies
* VS Code <br />
Visual Studio Code is the main code editor for Python scripts and high-level programming. This is not absolutely necessary, but from my experience, it gives us a great performance and we can link it with Git and Github easily.
```
https://code.visualstudio.com/
```

* MATLAB <br />
MATLAB is a great tool to work with Machine Learning Algorithms, however, you require a license to work with it.
My goal is to make a transition from MATLAB to Python in the long term. Simulink is a great tool for Dynamic Systems.
```

```

* Python <br />
Python is the main programming language that let us work fast, with easy and powerful integration of different software solutions.
```
https://www.python.org/
```


### Libraries and Package dependencies

* NUMPY <br />
NumPy is a great resource to work with arrays and concepts of linear algebra. This allows us to work with data and achieve scientific computing
```
https://numpy.org/
```

* PANDAS <br />
This is a powerful tool to manipulate and work with data. It is simple to use and built based on Python and NumPy library.
```
https://pandas.pydata.org/
```

* MATPLOTLIB <br />
This is a great Python library for creating static, animated and interactive data visualizations in a simple way.
```
https://matplotlib.org/
```

* SEABORN <br />
Library built "on top" of matplotlib, to create simple and powerful statistics plots.
```
https://seaborn.pydata.org/
```

* TKINTER <br />
Tkinter is an integrated Library that gives us a great way to create GUI windows with Python. It is also a cross-platform that has the 
advantage of working with the classic Tk windows and many libraries that integrate together to achieve amazing projects.
```
https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html
```

* PYINSTALLER <br />
Pyinstaller is a simple and effective way to generate executable files based on the applications developed in python language.
It gives us a lot of variations, and production options. It's important to look for its documentation for the correct usage.
```
https://www.pyinstaller.org/
```


## Usage :pencil2:
All projects are really well commented and most of them have specifications and remarks for their purpose.

I will be uploading most of the files, and try to keep it as clean as possible.
