#BASICS ON MATPLOTLIB LIBRARY
#Santiago Garcia Arango, July 2020

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

#In this script, we will use the Object Oriented approach of...
#... the matplotlib library. It is easier and gives us more...
#... control of the different plots and its applications.


#We define a figure for the creation of the plot
figure_1 = plt.figure()
